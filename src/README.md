### WORLD EDITOR SOURCE CODE ROADMAP

This file contains a brief overview to the source code for WorldEditor and friends. The intended audience is a developer looking to recycle parts of, or augment, WorldEditor.

### SOURCE TREE NOTES AND DEPENDENCIES

The XPTools source tree and its related derived binaries are generally open-source and may be dependent on GPL libraries. All new code written by Laminar for WorldEditor is available under the MIT/X11 license.

Each subtree in this source tree represents a \"package\" or set of components/ translation units/objects Each subtree directory will generally have a README.txt providing an overview of the theme for that module.

## APPLICATIONS

This source tree builds the following applications, all for Mac and Windows:

#### SCENERY EDITING

|  Tool Name  |                      Type                      |
| :----------: | :---------------------------------------------: |
| WorldEditor |                       GUI                       |
|  RenderFarm  | Console (This is LR\'s internal DSF generator.) |
| RenderFarmUI |   GUI (This is LR\'s internal DSF generator.)   |

#### XPTOOLS

| Tool Name    | Type    |
| ------------ | ------- |
| ObjConverter | Console |
| DSF2Text     | Console |
| DDSTool      | Console |
| MeshTool     | Console |
| ObjView      | GUI     |
| XGrinder     | GUI     |

#### AC3D

* XPlaneSupport             GUI

#### OneOffs (unrelated command-line tools that can be useful.)

* osm_tile                  	   Console
* osm2shape                 Console

> The code for some legacy projects like ObjEdit are probably floating around too.

### EXTERNAL LIBRARIES

All of the libraries used by these apps are linked as external static libraries even though they may have DLL/dylib/so versions. This is to minimize dependencies for end users.

### REQUIRED #DEFINE SYMBOLS

The following symbols are used that may need to be globally defined via the `-D` flag:

    **APL	IBM	LIN**
		These flags controls the target platform. Define oen of them to one and the others to zero.

    **DEV**
		This turns on the dev build/debugging - define to one or zero.

    **OPENGL_MAP**
		This adds OpenGL data to the XESCore map classes. This is needed to build WorldEditor. This is controlled by a flag because we don't want to spend memory on this data for the console version. Define to one or zero.

    **LIL BIG
		**These flags set the endian-ness of the executable (little or big).

    **USE_TIF, USE_JPEG
		**These eanble TIFF and JPEG support in BitmapUtils.h and other files. At this point all of the apps have these enabled, since libjpeg and libtiff are part of the standard library set.

### USE OF X-PLANE PLUGIN SYSTEM

    The UI version of the RenderFarm uses a modified version of the X-Plane widgets library (on top of an emulation of part of the XPLM 1.0 APIs) to do UI work. However all of the main binary distributed apps use the more portable, modern code in the UI and GUI directories.

> NOTE: while this code is available under the MIT/X11 license the original XPLM code is NOT.

#### RENDERFARM VS XES VS WED

Some of the naming conventions for the main scenery tools code for creating base meshes:

    -\"XES\" (X-Plane Editable Scenery) is a high level binary format for GIS data that is used by RenderFarm (see below). The \"XESCore\" package represent the core GIS engine used to make global scenery. While XES "RenderFarm" is the name of the internal program we use to generate the default scenery. It comes as a command-line tool and a UI version (the UI can only run command-line transforms and show results on a map - it is meant primarily for debugging).

Previously RenderFarm with UI was called \"WorldEditor\" and RenderFarm on the command line was called \"GISTool\". So \... most code that is in the \"WorldEditor\" folder is actually for RenderFarm (UI version), and most code labeled \"GISTool_XXXX\" is actually for the RenderFarm command-line version. Careful examination is necessary.

The actual WorldEditor 1.0 application is not based on any of the above code. Instead WED saves files to a database via sqlite3.

In the long term I expect the XESCore algorithms used by RenderFarm to also be used by WED, and I expect more code sharing between the UI and non-UI renderfarm apps, but I do not expect WED and RenderFarm to become one large app.
